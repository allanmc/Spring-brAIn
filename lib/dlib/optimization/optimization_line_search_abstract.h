              an alpha is found such that f(alpha) <= min_f then the search stops
              immediately.
            - This function is also optimized for the case where der(0) is negative.  I.e.
              positive values of the argument to f() should be in a descent direction.  
            - When this function makes calls to f() and der() it always does so by
              first calling f() and then calling der().  That is, these two functions
              are always called in pairs with f() being called first and then der()
              being called second.
